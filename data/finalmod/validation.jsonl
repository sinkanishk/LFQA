The Hazeltyne company would be happy to see him mark time for five years of so-called social reorientation. Everyone knows about muck men living in the mud while they hunt Slider eggs. On the space freighter that carried him from Earth Asa Graybar was confined to a small cabin that was opened only for a guard to bring meals and take out dirty dishes. Static crackled in Asa's earphones and he thought of what Kershaw had said, that the scintillation of an egg was an effect of its calls to a mother Slider for help. Through the transparent nose Asa could see Tom Dorr and Harriet Hazeltyne. He was sure Dorr would return for the egg. Finally he realized that Dorr could locate the egg approximately by the body of the dead Slider. Dorr could return for the egg any time with some other muck man to dig for it.

Then he smiled in relief, for it was the helicopter, the blessed helicopter, coming in over the swamp. No machine-gun blast of rockets came from the helicopter.

Since the first formal Medical Service Contract had been signed with Deneb III centuries before, Hospital Earth had laboriously built its reputation on that single foundation stone: immediate medical assistance, without question or hesitation, whenever and wherever it was required, on any planet bound by Contract. That was the law, for Hospital Earth could not afford to jeopardize a Contract. Other planets outstripped Earth in technology, in communications, in transport, and in production techniques\u2014but Earth stood unrivaled in its development of the biological sciences. On Deneb III the Medical Service Contract was formalized, and Hospital Earth came into being. Serious problems were shuttled back to Hospital Earth without delay; more frequently the GPP crews\u2014doctors of the Red and Green services, representing the ancient Earthly arts of medicine and surgery\u2014were able to handle the problems on the spot and by themselves.

Britain won, on average, 17 gold medals per Olympics in the five official games held in its imperial heyday before World War I. That average has dropped to only five medals per Olympics in the 17 held since. To take a trivial case, we know that the inheritance of extra fingers or toes is determined genetically. That is a claim that is impossible to test, because you cannot control, in an experimental sense, environmental differences among the study groups. It is scarcely surprising that Ethiopian or Kenyan distance runners do better than everyone else, since they are in the habit of running immense distances to and from primary school, middle school, and high school.

That said, the current president has every reason not to trust his Secret Service detail. Late at night, after his personal aides and the press have gone home, the president tells his Secret Service detail that he needs to take an \"off-the-record\" trip. He wants to leave the White House without his motorcade and without informing the press. The president invites a group of friends and staffers--including his paramour but not his wife--to spend the weekend at Camp David. Even though the guest list is not public, all the Navy and Marine personnel at Camp David, as well as the other guests, would know that the presidential entourage included an attractive woman, but not the first lady.

After all, those external dangers had been no more than potential for decades, since what Dr. Kilbillie called the Ungentlemanly Gentleman's War. The rise of the Projects, according to Dr. Kilbillie, was the result of many many factors, but two of the most important were the population explosion and the Treaty of Oslo. The Treaty of Oslo began by stating that atomic war was unthinkable, and added that just in case anyone happened to think of it only tactical atomic weapons could be used. Oddly enough, when somebody did think of the war, both sides adhered to the Treaty of Oslo, which meant that no Projects were bombed.

John Maynard Keynes himself was a magnificently subtle and innovative thinker. Before the 1936 publication of Keynes' The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money , economists had developed a rich and insightful theory of microeconomics , of the behavior of individual markets and the allocation of resources among them. Keynes was willing to concede that in some sufficiently long run, these theories might indeed be valid; but, as he memorably pointed out, \"In the long run we are all dead.\" Savings and investment were still necessarily equal; but if desired savings at full employment turned out to exceed desired investment, what would fall would be not interest rates but the level of employment and output.

{"context": "Its two main tenets were the quantity theory of money--the assertion that the overall level of prices was proportional to the quantity of money in circulation--and the \"loanable funds\" theory of interest, which asserted that interest rates would rise or fall to equate total savings with total investment. But in reality the Federal Reserve Board actively manages interest rates, pushing them down when it thinks employment is too low and raising them when it thinks the economy is overheating. Indeed, if you want a simple model for predicting the unemployment rate in the United States over the next few years, here it is: It will be what Greenspan wants it to be, plus or minus a random error reflecting the fact that he is not quite God. To accomplish this, the board must raise or lower interest rates to bring savings and investment at that target unemployment rate in line with each other. The obvious (to me) point that the average unemployment rate over the next 10 years will be what the Fed wants it to be, regardless of the U.S.-Mexico trade balance, never made it into the public consciousness.

Zundel hired Leuchter to go to Auschwitz and examine the \"alleged\" gas chambers: Footage (taken by Zundel's cameraman) shows the little man chiseling at walls, vandalizing what even he admits are international shrines. Is Leuchter a raving anti-Semite or a pathetic pawn who thrived on having--for the first time in his life--a bit of celebrity? Morris uses the Dutch historian Robert Jan van Pelt as a counternarrator: He calls Leuchter \"a fffool \" who didn't have a clue what to look for in a place that had changed enormously in 50 years. After my rage at Leuchter had subsided, I began to get angry at Morris for aestheticizing that violation--turning it into an ironic art object.

By the end of its two hours and 40 minutes, Topsy-Turvy has evolved into something extraordinary: a monument to process--to the minutiae of making art. It would be charitable to attribute the shapelessness of the early scenes to the characters' own lack of focus, but it would also be inane. Inevitably, something does happen: Princess Ida , one of Gilbert and Sullivan's duds, has its premiere, and Gilbert fumes over a review that calls him the monarch of \"topsy-turvydom\"--of formulaic plots involving magical elixirs and coins. Leigh evidently loves the bloodless formality of the scenes between Gilbert and Sullivan, men of opposite tastes and temperaments who only overlap in their work. The wake-up call comes an hour into the movie. As Leigh's camera pulls back over the orchestra and the audience, this movie feels like one of the saddest and loveliest tributes to the lives of artists ever made.

The leaking electricity would have broken any stray air down to ozone, which eats metal and rots lungs. So the engine room had the air pumped out of her, and the stokers who tended the dials and set the cathode attitudes had to wear suits, smelling themselves for twelve hours at a time and standing a good chance of cooking where they sat when the drive arced. When he found out, he closed it up and strapped it back in its place at the foot of the stoker's bunk. Not from the stoker, not from Mac. \"The stoker's jamming the circuit.\" It was an odd thing to see\u2014the stoker, and the Jek, who did not stand as tall.

Questions like this had been put to him often during the ten years since his rocket had hurtled through the meteorite belt and down to the surface of Tepokt, leaving him the only survivor.

Klaft, who had descended first, leaving the pilot to bring up the rear, noticed Kinton's pause. Kinton could not remember him, but everyone on the planet addressed the Terran by the sound they fondly thought to be his first name. Meanwhile, Birken seemed eager to learn all Kinton could tell him about the planet, Tepokt. \"You, too, have citizens who do not always obey, your laws, who sometimes ... that is\u2014\" \"Who are born to die under the axe, as we say,\" interrupted Klaft, as if to ease the concern plain on Kinton's face. \"Why did he say he was traveling that way?\" asked Kinton, thinking to himself of the spaceship!", "query": " Who did Kinton want to land on Tepokt?", "option_0": " A woman", "option_1": " Anyone", "option_2": " A man", "option_3": " Birken", "label": 0}

Barred off as they were from venturing into space, the highly civilized Tepoktans constantly displayed the curiosity of dreamers in matters related to the universe. \"As I believe I mentioned in some of my recorded lectures,\" Kinton answered in their language, [103] \"the number is actually as vast as it seems to those of you peering through the Dome of Eyes. Even though he was the first stellar visitor in their recorded history, Kinton remained conscious of the fact that in many fields he was unable to offer the Tepoktans any new ideas. To help himself forget the rather preoccupied manner in which some of the Tepoktan scientists occasionally eyed him, he peered down at the big dam of the hydro-electric project being completed to Kinton's design. Power from this would soon light the town built to house the staff of scientists, students, and workers assigned to the institute organized about the person of Kinton.

{"context": "For all these reasons, I\u2019ll focus in this chapter on how to pay for gold OA (journals), not how to pay for green OA (repositories). There\u2019s still room for creativity in finding ways to pay the costs of a peer-reviewed OA journal, and many smart and motivated people are exploring different possibilities. On the contrary, researchers who don\u2019t know about OA repositories still understand that there are OA journals. The most comprehensive survey to date shows that an overwhelming 89 percent of researchers from all fields believe that OA journals are beneficial to their fields. Apart from the myth that all OA is gold OA, the most common myth about gold OA is that all OA journals charge \u201cauthor fees\u201d or use an \u201cauthor-pays\u201d business model. These false beliefs also support the insinuation that OA journals are more likely than non-OA journals to compromise on peer review. But if charging author-side fees for accepted papers really creates an incentive to lower standards, in order to rake in more fees, then most toll-access journals are guilty and most OA journals are not. In effect: \u201cAt OA journals, authors pay to be published; now let me ask you a series of questions about your attitude toward OA journals.\u201d There are two kinds of OA journals, full and hybrid. Moreover, an overwhelming majority of full-OA journals charge no publication fees and the overwhelming majority of hybrid-OA journals never gain firsthand experience with no-fee business models.", "query": " How are hybrid OA journals different from full OA journals?", "option_0": " Hybrid OA journals employ green OA practices while full OA journals employ gold OA practices", "option_1": " Hybrid OA journals have some toll-access content and some OA content", "option_2": " Hybrid OA journals are much riskier for publishers", "option_3": " Hybrid OA journals only have toll-access content", "label": 1}
{"context": "Before turning to gold OA, however, I should note that there are widely varying estimates in the literature on what it costs a university to run an institutional repository. There\u2019s still room for creativity in finding ways to pay the costs of a peer-reviewed OA journal, and many smart and motivated people are exploring different possibilities. The first is to assume that there is only one business model for OA journals, when there are many. The third is to assume that all or even most OA journals charge upfront fees. A handful of studies have calculated that after a general conversion of peer-reviewed journals to OA, high-output universities would pay more in author-side fees than they pay now in subscriptions. Some hybrid OA journals promise to reduce subscription prices in proportion to author uptake of the OA option, that is, to charge subscribers only for the toll-access articles. One powerful way to reduce costs without reducing quality is to use free and open-source journal management software to automate the clerical tasks on this list. However, the full range of OA journals begins to look like a success story when we consider that the vast majority of the money needed to support peer-reviewed journals is currently tied up in subscriptions to conventional journals. One is the voluntary conversion of toll-access journals to OA.

By contrast, most toll-access journals (75 percent) do charge author-side fees. Moreover, even within the minority of fee-based OA journals, only 12 percent of those authors end up paying the fees out of pocket. The false beliefs that most OA journals charge author-side fees and that most toll-access journals don\u2019t have caused several kinds of harm. For example, most fee-based OA journals will waive their fees in cases of economic hardship, and take pains to prevent editors and referees engaged in peer review from knowing whether or not an author has requested a fee waiver. The false belief that most OA journals charge author-side fees also infects studies in which authors misinform survey subjects before surveying them. Fee-based OA journals tend to work best in fields where most research is funded, and no-fee journals tend to work best in fields and countries where comparatively little research is funded.

But as more academics understand the green/gold distinction, and understand that well-written green OA mandates are compatible with academic freedom, more institutions are adopting green OA mandates, almost always at the initiative of faculty themselves. At universities, there are roughly three approaches to green OA mandates: Loophole mandates These require green OA except when the author\u2019s publisher doesn\u2019t allow it. They can encourage green and gold OA, or they can require green OA. We should never forget that most toll-access journals already allow green OA and that a growing number of high-quality, high-prestige peer-reviewed journal are gold OA.
